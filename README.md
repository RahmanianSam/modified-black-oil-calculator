# 🧪 Modified Black Oil Property Calculator — Without EOS

This Excel-based tool allows engineers and researchers to extract **modified black oil properties**—specifically the **vaporized oil–gas ratio (Rv)** and **dry gas formation volume factor (Bgd)**—from laboratory CVD and CCE test data without using an EOS model.

---

## 🔍 Why This Tool?

Traditional black oil models don’t capture mutual solubility between hydrocarbon phases, especially in gas condensate or volatile oil systems. This tool offers a practical alternative to compositional simulation by extending the Walsh & Towler material balance method with key corrections.

---

## 📊 What It Does

- Calculates Rv, Bgd, Bo, and Rs across the depletion path
- Fixes original Walsh & Towler issues:
  - Z-factor now applied at dew point volume
  - Accounts for dry gas in early CVD stages
- Works directly from CVD and CCE lab results
- Provides outputs suitable for black oil simulation workflows
